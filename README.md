# Pro-Palestine Zuccotti Park Protest: A Scrolly Telling Story

## About
This is my first attempt at creating a scrolly telling story. It is a photo essay documenting the protest that took place at Zuccotti Park on May 26, 2024. The objective of this assignment was to use a scrolly telling template to present the photo essay.

## Photos
The photos included in this project were captured using my Pixel 6a. You can find the photos with citations and links to my social profiles: [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/architjm/), [X](https://twitter.com/ArchitMeta)
